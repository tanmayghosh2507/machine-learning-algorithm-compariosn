Comparison of various ML algorithms on Iris UCI data set based on classification accuracy.

This project can be considered as a starting point for the understanding the implementation of the various Machine Learning models to analyze the data and then further make predictions.

The project has 5 major components:
1. Import Libraries: Used Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn and other useful libraries.
2. Data Load: Loaded the data from UCI website.
3. Data Visualization: Visualized the data using univariate and multivariate plots.
4. Evaluate Algorithms: I compared the following 4 algorithms on the dataset:
	a. Linear Regression
	b. K-Nearest Neighbors
	c. Gaussian Naive Bayes
	d. Support Vector Machine 
5. Make predictions: Chose the best model based on the accuracy of each of the 4 models and ran the model to make predictions on the validation set.

The accuracy came out to be pretty good, 97.8%.

Note: This project heavily focuses on the implementation side of the algorithms and doesn't focus on how the algorithm works.

For further improvements, you can make changes and raise a PR.
